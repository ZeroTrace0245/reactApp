Work Report: Demo Appointments & Export Documentation (2024-06-17)

Summary
- Added appointment demo data and refreshed docs for exports and use-case coverage.

Changes
- Seeded mock appointments (IDs APT-301100..102) with patient, clinician, schedule, and notes for table preview.
- Updated documentation to describe status snapshot CSV export and added `docs/UseCase_UML.md` with a PlantUML use-case diagram.

Impact
- Demo builds show populated appointments; no backend persistence added.
- Documentation now explains export interactions and actor/use-case mapping.

Verification
- Manual check: appointments table renders with seeded entries; status export doc present.
- Pending team review before rollout; no production deployment.
