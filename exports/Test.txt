Summary
- UI refinements for spacing and theming to improve visual consistency.

Changes
- Adjusted card spacing/margins in dashboard sections for alignment across columns.
- Applied unified dialog styling (app.css) to entry prompts for patients/inventory/appointments to match the dark theme.

Impact
- Visual polish only; no change to workflows or data handling.

Verification
- Manual check: dialogs inherit theme, buttons align correctly, no layout overflow observed.
