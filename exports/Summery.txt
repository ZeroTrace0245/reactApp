Summary
- Seeded demo data for patients and inventory to ensure the dashboard renders meaningful content out of the box.

Changes
- Added five patient records (Mara Vega, Hector Liao, Priya Sen, Elena Brooks, Ravi Patel) with status/room assignments.
- Added inventory items with IDs and pricing (masks, IV sets, syringes, gowns, defibrillator pads) to drive the inventory table.

Impact
- UI previews show populated lists/tables; no runtime logic changes.
- Low inventory metric now reflects seeded counts (<100 threshold).

Verification
- Manual check: launched dashboard, verified patients and inventory tables populate and stats update.
- No automated tests affected (data-only change).
